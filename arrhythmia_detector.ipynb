    "### What is a Cardiac Arrhythmia?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cardiac arrhythmias occur when the electrical impulses of the heart don't function properly. This can cause your heart to beat too quick, too slow, or beat irregularly. For some this may feel like a fluttering or pain in the chest. Arrhythmias may also manifest as anxiety, fatigue, sweating, dizziness, or fainting.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "The causes of arrhythmias varies greatly. These can range from smoking, drinking, and genetics to heat attacks, high blood pressure, and diabetes. Certain types of arrhythmias may put one at higher risk of serious medical conditions such as stroke and heart failure.\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "Preventing cardiac arrhythmias often involves adopting a heart-healthy lifestyle. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Eating a heart-healthy diet\n",
    "- Staying active and maintaining a healthy weight\n",
    "- Limiting caffeine and alcohol\n",
    "- Reducing stress\n",
    "- Carefully using certain over-the-counter medicines that can trigger arrhythmias\n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",

    "### What is an ECG?\n",
    "\n",
    "An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) measures the the electrical activity of the heart. A normal heartbeat presents certain notable features in the ECG signal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The left and right atria make the first wave, the P-wave.\n",
    "- The left and right bottom chambers make the following wave, the QRS complex.\n",
    "- Finally, the electrical recovery back to a resting state creates the final wave, the T-wave. \n",
    "<br/><br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "ECGs give medical professionals indespinsable knowledge about the function of the heart. They show the speed and regularity of the electrical activity of the heart. They may also indicate abmormalities in the features of the heart.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Our optimized deep neural network returned an accuracy on our test data of ~95%. From our confusion matrix we note that the statistically significant majority our false predictions involve classifying the signal of a normal heartbeat as an arrhythmia. In terms of medical diagnostics, this is certainly better than letting a serious arrhythmia go undetected. We also note that our model failed to learn any notable patterns on type 1 arrhythmias - supraventricular premature beats."

    "### Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "After training our optimized deep neural network on 100000 ECG signals we were able to make accurate predictions on ~95% of our testing data. Of the incorrect prediction, the statistically significant ones were where our model classified a regular signal as that of one signifying an arrhythmia. As mentioned prior, this is certainly better than letting a serious arrhythmia go undetected. A more balanced testing dataset could yield different results, though.\n",

    "<a id=\"limitations\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps the most evident limitation to our data is the severe class imbalance. A higher amount of authentic training data for the underrepresented arrhythmia types could have helped our model accurately predict these on our testing data. Though this was attempted to be combated by resampling and adding noise to our signals, this does not make up to high-quality authentic data.  Modifying the number of epochs our final model trained for could possible increase performance as well. Minimal computing power prevents a a more exhaustive hyperparamter search from being completed; it is likely that a different combination of layers, nodes, and evaluation techniques would yield better performance.\n",

    "Different types of neural networks could yield higher accuracies. For example, [Gregoire DC](https://www.kaggle.com/gregoiredc)'s model hosted on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gregoiredc/arrhythmia-on-ecg-classification-using-cnn) achieved a high level of accuracy using a convolutional neural network (CNN). A long short term memory network (LSTM) have been shown to provide high accuracy on temporal and signal data such as our ECGs.\n",
